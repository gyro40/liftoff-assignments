## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project will be a milage and tips tracker for delivery drivers. It will allow users to log in, and to create and edit work details such as date/time, store name, driver/user name, 
tip amounts, mileage driven, bad/good descriptive box, other delivery expenses, and an hours log. 
	
This project was motivated by years of being a delivery driver myself, and knowing there should be an organized way to track mileage, tips, and hours worked while delivering. 
Having these items documented and recorded for tax purposes and personal use would be of great use.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to further my knowledge of of connecting projects to a DB along with working on a project of this size. I will look into using Bootstrap after learning more about it. 
I would like to use Google Maps with this application which would require learning more about API's and how to work with them on my own application.
